CAT, the Configuration Assistant Tool for Enterprise Wi-Fi networks such as eduroam
===================================================================================

CAT collects information about RADIUS/EAP deployments from Wi-Fi network administrators and generates simple-to-use, good-looking, and secure installation programs for users of these networks. The goal is to vastly improve the network security by pushing secure Wi-Fi settings to all users without the need to expose them to or require them to understand all of the underlying technologies and configuration parameters.
