When upgrading from the newest CAT 1.1 database structure:

- run 1_1-2_0.sql to convert the schema
- run 1_1-2_0-script.php for the data conversion

When deploying CAT 2.0 from scratch:

- use schema.sql to create a new schema

When upgrading from CAT 2.0 beta2 to beta3:

- run this SQL command: 
  alter table silverbullet_certificate add column `ca_type` ENUM('RSA','ECDSA') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'RSA';
- rename the existing RSA keys from rootca.pem, real.pem, real.key to rootca-RSA.pem. real-RSA.pem, real-RSA.key
- add the ECDSA variants as rootca-ECDSA.pem, real-ECDSA.pem, real-ECDSA.key
- there are two new class constants in Devices-template.php. Remember to carry the two LOC over to Devices.php
- for each device which should get ECDSA certificates, set $Options['clientcert'] to Devices::SUPPORT_ECDSA and make SUPPORT_RSA the default in the global $Options
